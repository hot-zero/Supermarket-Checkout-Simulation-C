interactions within a supermarket checkout simulation were addressed. Integrating components like MainWindow, InvoiceController, TableViewmanager, StockController, and PaymentProcessor required efficient data exchange and coordination. A key challenge was dynamically updating table views for item modifications, ensuring data consistency across all views. The payment processing phase demanded accurate transfer of details to the InvoiceController. Real-time updates in basket management and product search needed optimized algorithms to avoid performance issues, ensuring a smooth user experience. Data validation and integrity were critical in stock updates and payment processing, necessitating thorough testing and robust error handling. Additionally, designing an intuitive and engaging interface was essential for user satisfaction. The system was developed with an emphasis on efficiency, security, and usability, aiming to be reliable and user-friendly for an expanding inventory and customer base (Nystrom, 2014).
4.1 Integration of System Components
In this project, integrating system components such as MainWindow, InvoiceController, StockController, TableViewManager, and PaymentProcessor was a complex task. MainWindow served as the core, handling product displays, payment processing, 
and stock management. This required real-time communication and precise data transfer between MainWindow and other modules, particularly for accurately 
capturing payment details in invoices. Ensuring a consistent, responsive user 
interface was crucial. Actions in TableViewManager, like item modifications, 
had to be instantly updated system-wide without data integrity issues. Overcoming 
these integration challenges was key to achieving a seamless user 
experience and operational efficiency (Bass, Clements, and Kazman, 2012).

4.2 Table View Management
The TableViewManager was crucial for displaying and managing product data in QTableView widgets. It enabled adding, updating, and deleting products, ensuring real-time updates across the user interface. This required complex interactions with the StockData class for retrieving and manipulating item details. Essential for maintaining an accurate product inventory representation, the TableViewManager's dynamic update handling was a key component in the system's efficiency (doc.qt.io, n.d.).

4.2.1 Constructor
TableViewManager(QObject *parent) : QObject(parent), tableView(nullptr): The constructor initializes the TableViewManager with a parent object and sets the tableView pointer to nullptr. It ensures that the TableViewManager is ready to manage a table view but doesn't associate it with a specific table view yet.
4.2.2 Destructor
~TableViewManager(): The destructor cleans up resources used by the TableViewManager. 
4.2.3 Method: preloadDefaultProducts
void preloadDefaultProducts(): This method loads a set of default products into the StockData. It checks if the items list in StockData is empty and, if so, adds default product items. These items are instances of the Item class, each representing a different product.
4.2.4 Method: setupTableView
void setupTableView(QTableView *tableView): This method sets up a QTableView widget. It assigns a model (QStandardItemModel) to the table view, which is used to store and manage the data displayed in the table. The method also configures selection behavior, edit triggers, and header labels.
4.2.5 Method: addProduct
void addProduct(Product* product): Adds a new product to the list of products managed by TableViewManager. If a table view is already set up, it updates the table view to reflect the new product.
4.2.6 Method: loadProductsToModel
void loadProductsToModel(QStandardItemModel *model): This method is responsible for loading the products into the table view's model. It sets column headers and adjusts the appearance of the table view. It iterates over the items in StockData and adds each item as a row in the table view's model.
4.2.7 Method: setupBaskettblView
void setupBaskettblView(QTableView *BaskettableView): Similar to setupTableView, this method sets up another table view (presumably for the basket/cart feature). It configures the model, headers, and appearance specific to the basket table view.
4.2.8 Understanding the Workflow
•	Initialization: When an instance of TableViewManager is created, it's ready to manage table views but is not yet associated with any specific view.
•	Loading Products: preloadDefaultProducts can be called to load a predefined list of products into the system. This is useful for initializing the system with a set of starter data.
•	Setting Up Views: setupTableView and setupBaskettblView are used to prepare different table views for displaying products and basket contents, respectively. They ensure that the views are properly configured to display data.
•	Managing Products: Products can be added dynamically using addProduct, and loadProductsToModel ensures these changes are reflected in the associated table view (doc.qt.io, n.d.).

4.3 Payment Processing and Data Transfer
The PaymentProcessor class is vital for handling customer payments. It calculates total item costs and processes different payment methods (cash or card). Key features include:
•	Purpose: Manages financial transactions, calculates totals, and accommodates various payment methods.
•	Attributes: Tracks subtotal, tax rate, and manages UI elements for displaying payment information.
•	Methods:
•	update_ItemCost: Computes the subtotal and total amount by summing item prices and applying tax.
•	PayButton: Executes the payment process, determining payment type, calculating change, validating payment sufficiency, updating the UI, and notifying other components like InvoiceController of successful payments.
•	ClearData: Resets payment data and UI elements, clearing the basket and payment fields.
This class is essential for ensuring accurate financial transactions and a smooth checkout experience.
Workflow:
The PaymentProcessor class streamlines financial transactions through distinct workflow steps:
•	Calculating Costs: Invokes update_ItemCost to update the subtotal, tax, and total when items are added to the basket.
•	Processing Payment: The PayButton function is activated upon payment initiation. It retrieves, validates payment details, and if correct, emits a PaymentSuccessful signal.
•	Resetting Data: Post-transaction or basket reset, ClearData clears all payment data for the next transaction.
For data transfer and communication, the class utilizes Qt's signal and slot mechanism for application-wide coordination. It directly interacts with UI elements like QTextEdit and QTableView, maintaining an updated interface with transaction details. PaymentProcessor is integral for accurate billing and efficient transaction management in the checkout system (Martin, 2003).
4.4 Stock Management
The StockController is integral to inventory management in the supermarket system, interfacing with the graphical user interface for efficient stock item management. It updates product details, manages categories, and tracks inventory in real-time, with dynamic reflection in the user interface through integration with TableViewManager. StockController's data validation ensures stock data integrity and accuracy.

Setting Up Invoice Table View: Configures the invoice table view to display transaction items using tableViewManager.
Updating Invoice Model: Reflects basket items in the invoice's table view model, ensuring the invoice mirrors the current transaction.
Printing Invoice: Manages printing settings and user interaction for invoice printing, using QPrinter and QPainter for drawing invoice content.
Utility Functions: Includes functions like updateDateLabel and OrderNumber for updating date and time and generating a random order number.
Overall, InvoiceController efficiently displays and prints invoices, reflecting up-to-date transaction details. It works in tandem with components like MainWindow and PaymentProcessor for accurate data presentation (doc.qt.io, n.d.).

4.6 Card Payment Processing
The CardController class manages credit or debit card payments. As an extension of the QDialog class, it offers a graphical interface for entering card details like number, expiry date, CVV2, and cardholder's name. The class rigorously validates these inputs: checking the card number's 16-digit format, the expiry date's MMYY format, and a 3-digit CVV2. It displays error messages for invalid data or expired cards, ensuring security and a streamlined user experience (PCI Quick Reference Guide).
Key functions include:
•	on_btnPayCard_clicked(): Processes card payment after validating details and checking card expiry against the current date.
•	on_btnResetCard_clicked(): Clears input fields for a new transaction.
•	on_btnExitCard_clicked(): Closes the card payment dialog.
These features, coupled with integration with a PaymentProcessor, ensure secure, accurate transactions and smooth user interactions within the checkout flow.

4.7 Core of Product Management
The Item class is central to product management in the supermarket checkout simulation, covering various product types with attributes like id, itemName, description, barcode, price, quantity, and category. It offers default and parameterized constructors for creating item objects either with preset values or as templates for later use. The class ensures data integrity and controlled access through getter and setter methods for each attribute. Subclasses such as Food, Electronic, and Bakery, which extend the Item class, enable effective categorization in a diverse inventory. This structure facilitates efficient inventory management and accommodates a broad range of product types (Martin, 2009).
